Sure! In **Azure**, identities are used to **securely authenticate and authorize applications, services, and workloads** without always using usernames and passwords. Let me break down **Service Principals, Federated Identities, Managed Identities, and Workload Identities**, along with **where to find them in Azure**.

---

## **1. Service Principal (SP)**

* **What it is:**
  A **Service Principal (SP)** is an **identity in Azure AD** that an application or service can use to **authenticate and access resources**.

    * Think of it as the **‚Äúuser account‚Äù for an application**.
    * It has **Client ID (App ID)**, **Client Secret/Certificate**, and **Tenant ID**.

* **Use cases:**

    * Terraform authenticating to Azure
    * Azure DevOps pipelines connecting to Azure
    * Applications accessing Azure Storage, Key Vault, etc.

* **Where to find in Azure:**

    * **Azure Active Directory ‚Üí App registrations ‚Üí \[Your App]**
    * **Azure Active Directory ‚Üí Enterprise applications ‚Üí \[Your SP]**

---

## **2. Federated Identity (OIDC Federation)**

* **What it is:**
  A **federated identity** allows **external identity providers** (GitHub, AWS, GCP, or any OIDC-compliant provider) to **authenticate directly to Azure without secrets**.

    * Uses **OpenID Connect (OIDC)** tokens instead of storing **client secrets**.
    * This is the **modern, secretless authentication** for CI/CD.

* **Use cases:**

    * GitHub Actions deploys to Azure using OIDC without secrets
    * Cross-cloud authentication without storing keys

* **Where to find in Azure:**

    * **Azure Active Directory ‚Üí App registrations ‚Üí \[Your App] ‚Üí Certificates & Secrets ‚Üí Federated credentials**

## **3. Managed Identity**

* **What it is:**
  A **Managed Identity** is a **system-managed Service Principal** automatically created by Azure for a service instance (VM, Function App, App Service, etc.).

    * Azure **manages the lifecycle and rotates credentials automatically**.
    * **Two types:**

        1. **System-assigned** ‚Äì Tied to a single resource; deleted if the resource is deleted.
        2. **User-assigned** ‚Äì Created independently and can be assigned to multiple resources.

* **Use cases:**

    * A VM or Function App accessing Azure Key Vault without secrets
    * Logic Apps, Azure Functions, or AKS pods authenticating to Azure securely

* **Where to find in Azure:**

    * **Resource ‚Üí Identity (left menu)** to enable/disable Managed Identity
    * **Azure Active Directory ‚Üí Enterprise applications** (Managed identities appear as SPs)

---

## **4. Workload Identity (New, for AKS and beyond)**

* **What it is:**
  **Azure Workload Identity** integrates **Kubernetes workloads** (AKS) with **Azure AD using OIDC federation**.

    * It‚Äôs a **modern replacement for AAD Pod Identity**.
    * Allows pods to **use federated identities instead of secrets** to access Azure resources.

* **Use cases:**

    * AKS pods accessing Key Vault, Storage, Event Hubs securely
    * Multi-cloud workloads that authenticate via OIDC

* **Where to find in Azure:**

    * **AKS cluster ‚Üí Workload Identity** settings
    * Linked **App Registrations** in Azure AD with **Federated credentials**

## **üîπ Summary Table**

| Identity Type          | Who Uses It                  | Secretless? | Where in Azure Portal                                              |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Service Principal**  | Apps, scripts, CI/CD         | ‚ùå No        | Azure AD ‚Üí App registrations / Enterprise applications             |
| **Federated Identity** | External OIDC providers      | ‚úÖ Yes       | App registrations ‚Üí Certificates & Secrets ‚Üí Federated credentials |
| **Managed Identity**   | Azure resources (VM, AppSvc) | ‚úÖ Yes       | Resource ‚Üí Identity / Azure AD ‚Üí Enterprise applications           |
| **Workload Identity**  | AKS pods / workloads         | ‚úÖ Yes       | AKS Cluster ‚Üí Workload Identity / Azure AD App Registration        |

If you want, I can **draw a visual architecture** showing **how each identity authenticates to Azure services** for a clear understanding.

Do you want that?
