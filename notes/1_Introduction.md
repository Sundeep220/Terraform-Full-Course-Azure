That’s a great decision, Sundeep! Terraform is one of the most powerful and widely used **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** tools, especially for managing cloud infrastructure in a **declarative and consistent** way.

Let’s start from **scratch** and build your notes in a **progressive, structured** manner. You can copy this into your notes directly.

## 🧠 **Terraform Basics – Beginner Notes**

---

### 🔹 What is Terraform?

**Terraform** is an **open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** tool developed by **HashiCorp**. It allows you to define, provision, and manage infrastructure (servers, databases, networks, etc.) across many cloud providers and services using **code**.

---

### 🔹 Why Terraform?

* ✅ **Declarative Language**: You describe *what* you want, not *how* to get it.
* ✅ **Multi-cloud Support**: Works with AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, etc.
* ✅ **Immutable Infrastructure**: Infrastructure changes are applied in a controlled and predictable way.
* ✅ **Automation**: Removes manual tasks; perfect for CI/CD.
* ✅ **Version Control**: Code can be committed and tracked via Git.

### 🔹 What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?

IaC means managing and provisioning infrastructure through **code and automation**, instead of manual processes or GUI-based tools (like AWS Console).

**Analogy**: Instead of manually clicking buttons to create a server, you write a script to define it, and Terraform does the rest.

### 🔹 Key Components of Terraform

| Component      | Description                                                                |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Providers**  | Interface between Terraform and the cloud/service (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP). |
| **Resources**  | The actual infrastructure elements (e.g., EC2, S3, VPC).                   |
| **Modules**    | Group of Terraform files reused like functions in code.                    |
| **State File** | A file (`terraform.tfstate`) that tracks the current infrastructure.       |
| **Variables**  | Used to parameterize configurations.                                       |
| **Outputs**    | Display useful information like IP addresses after apply.                  |

### 🔹 Terraform Workflow (Very Important!)

```plaintext
1. Write  → Write Terraform configuration files (.tf)
2. Init   → Initialize the working directory → `terraform init`
3. Plan   → See what Terraform will do → `terraform plan`
4. Apply  → Apply the changes and create/update infrastructure → `terraform apply`
5. Destroy → Tear down infrastructure when needed → `terraform destroy`
```

---

### 🔹 Terraform Configuration Language

Terraform uses **HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language)** – a human-readable, declarative language.

Example:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "my_ec2" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

### 🔹 Supported Cloud Providers

* ✅ AWS
* ✅ Azure
* ✅ Google Cloud (GCP)
* ✅ Kubernetes
* ✅ Oracle Cloud
* ✅ DigitalOcean
* ✅ VMware, OpenStack, and many others.

### 🔹 Terraform vs Other IaC Tools

| Feature      | Terraform   | CloudFormation | Ansible    |
| ------------ | ----------- | -------------- | ---------- |
| Language     | HCL         | JSON/YAML      | YAML       |
| Provisioning | Declarative | Declarative    | Procedural |
| Multi-cloud  | ✅           | ❌ (AWS only)   | ✅          |
| State Mgmt   | ✅           | ✅              | ❌          |

---

### 🔹 Terraform Files

* `main.tf` – Main configuration
* `variables.tf` – Input variables
* `outputs.tf` – Output values
* `terraform.tfvars` – Actual values for variables
* `.terraform/` – Internal state and plugin data
* `terraform.tfstate` – Stores current state

---

### 🔹 Real-Life Use Cases

* Provisioning EC2 instances, VPCs in AWS.
* Creating Azure resource groups, app services.
* Deploying GCP storage buckets or VMs.
* Setting up Kubernetes clusters (EKS, GKE, AKS).
* Automating multi-cloud infrastructure.

| -------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| IaC      | Infrastructure as Code                          |
| HCL      | HashiCorp Configuration Language                |
| Provider | Plugin to connect Terraform to a cloud or tool  |
| Resource | The thing you're creating (like a VM or bucket) |
| Plan     | Show what will change                           |
| Apply    | Make the changes                                |
| Destroy  | Delete the infrastructure                       |
