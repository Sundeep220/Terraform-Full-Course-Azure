Great! Let’s now look at the next important concept:

---

## ✅ **2. Resources**

### 🔹 What is a Resource?

A **resource** in Terraform is the **actual infrastructure object** you want to manage. It can be anything like:

* A virtual machine (e.g., EC2 in AWS)
* A storage bucket (e.g., S3)
* A network (e.g., VPC)
* A database (e.g., RDS)

---

### 💡 Analogy (Programming Perspective):

Think of a **resource** like creating an object from a class in Java.

```java
// Java analogy
EC2Instance instance = new EC2Instance("t2.micro", "ami-abc123");
```

In Terraform, it’s written like:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web_server" {
  ami           = "ami-abc123"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

So here:

* `"aws_instance"` → The *type* of resource (like the class name)
* `"web_server"` → The *name* you give this instance (like a variable)
* Inside the `{}` → Configuration (like constructor parameters or setters)

---

### 🛠️ What does a Resource do?

* It defines **what you want to create**.
* When you run `terraform apply`, it creates that infrastructure on your cloud provider.

---

### 🔁 Terraform Resource Syntax

```hcl
resource "<PROVIDER>_<RESOURCE_TYPE>" "<NAME>" {
  # configuration...
}
```

Example:

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "my_bucket" {
  bucket = "sundeep-demo-bucket"
  acl    = "private"
}
```

This creates a private S3 bucket named `sundeep-demo-bucket`.
